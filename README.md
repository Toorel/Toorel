# Hello

Hi! My name is Toorese, a masters's student in Policy and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. Huge fan of soccer, basketball and problem solver.

I am very interssted in the way data can be used toshape policy. But I am evern more intersted in the very ways data has also been sued to create various naratives. Before coming to graduate school, I worked as a Policy and Data Analyst for the FRSC. Before that, I worked as an analyst for a fintech start-up in Lagos, Nigeria called QuickCheck. Through both these experiences, it was very fascinating to see the way collated was used in a very deliberate fashion to make decisions. I came to Heinz to work on my technical skills and see the various ways I can improve my analytical capabilities.

In my time here, I have learnt:

- SQL
- R, Python
- Optimization using excel and Gurobi/Python
- Hadoop, Spark
- Tableau, Flourish
- Supervised and Unsupervised learning

In my free time, I love to:

- visit new places
- watch anime
